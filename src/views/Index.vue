      <p>
      The new brand identity is inspired by work of Gustav Klimt and the Vienna Secession.
      In particular, the use of strong and repeating geometric shapes provided a strong basis
      for a unique identity system for Vienna Patisserie.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      A simple, yet intricate pattern not only forms the brandmark but a highly flexible
      and powerful visual language with a strong nod to Vienna but also the brand’s home
      in Melbourne.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      A striking and rich colour palette of gold, black, white and dark browns enable the brand
      to be dialled up for more premium gifts such as cake boxes, instore graphics and signage,
      or paired back to provide understated yet practical bags for breads and pastries.
      </p>

      Vienna Patisserie has two stores in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs with plans for more stores
      in the future. Their current stores are located at Maling Road Canterbury
      and High Street Kew East.
